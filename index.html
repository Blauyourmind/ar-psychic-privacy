    <h1>AR Psychic Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Michael Blau built the AR Psychic app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Michael Blau and is intended for use as is. 
        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service. 
        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. 
        I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>AR Psychic does not track your usage, location, or any other information.  
        Once our applications are installed on your iPhone, they do not communicate with 
        our servers in any way. Some of our Apps use TrueDepth APIs which uses the front 
        camera system to track the movement of your eyes, mouth, and face. 
        In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device’s camera. 
        This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device’s settings. 
        The camera images and resulting depth data are only used for the “AR Psychic” 
        app. No information is collected and nothing is stored locally or remotely. 
        Camera access is required to get depth data from Apple’s API’s. 
        Face data is never stored remotely, given to third parties, or used for any purposes. 
        The data only remains on your device, and never leaves your device at any time.  
        This data is stored on the device only for the duration of your current app session. 
        After deleting the App all data within the app will also be deleted.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, 
        in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information 
        (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. 
        This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, 
        device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing 
        my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. 
        Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. 
        I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        This policy is effective as of 2020-06-03</p>
